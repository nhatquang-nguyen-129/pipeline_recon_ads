RECON UPDATE MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
This module performs **incremental updates** of advertising spend  
data at the raw layer, consolidating delivery and cost information  
from all ad networks and reconciling it against planned budgets.

It is designed to support scheduled refreshes, multi-platform cost  
aggregation, and budget vs. actual spend tracking as the foundation  
for downstream staging and MART layers.

‚úîÔ∏è Supports multi-platform ingestion (Facebook, Google Ads, TikTok, etc.)  
‚úîÔ∏è Consolidates spend data across networks into a unified structure  
‚úîÔ∏è Performs reconciliation with budget allocation at campaign/program level  
‚úîÔ∏è Loads data incrementally to minimize latency and ensure freshness  

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is responsible for *RAW layer updates only*. It does  
not perform advanced transformations or generate staging/MART tables  
directly.
