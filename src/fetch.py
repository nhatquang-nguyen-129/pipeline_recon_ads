BUDGET FETCHING MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
This module handles direct, authenticated data retrievel from 
predefined Google Sheets sources, consolidating all fetching logic 
into a unified, maintainable structure for ingestion.

It ensures reliable access to Budget Allocation data with controlled 
rate limits, standardized field mapping, and structured outputs for 
downstream enrichment and transformation stages.

✔️ Initializes securely via Google Drive/Spreadsheets credentials  
✔️ Fetches Budget Allocation data via authenticated API calls  
✔️ Handles pagination, rate limiting and error retries automatically
✔️ Returns normalized and schema-ready DataFrames for processing  
✔️ Logs detailed runtime information for monitoring and debugging  

⚠️ This module is focused solely on budget data retrieval.  
It does not perform downstream validation, transformation, or 
data warehouse operations such as Google BigQuery ingestion.
