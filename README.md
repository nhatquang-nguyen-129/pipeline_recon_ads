The system is designed with a **modular architecture** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and controlled evolution over time.

## Overview

> **This README documents the behavior and scope of the current architecture development branch:**  
> **`branch_2x`**

`branch_2x` represents the active **2.x development line**, focusing on large-scale feature upgrades and platform standardization—migrating from raw Python/SQL execution to structured DAG-based pipelines with dbt, standardized ETL and backfill support, scalable internal plugins, and modern dependency management via conditional installs and pip-tools compilation.

## Deployment

development_branch → main → deploy

| Branch | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `main` | **Production** – stable, deployed pipeline |
| `current_branch` | Active development for oldest version **x.x** (current branch) |
| `development_branch` | Major architectural redesigns or framework rewrites |
